# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Description
For my first homework assignment, I was asked to take existing website code and fix it so that it would meet accessibility standards.
### What did I learn from all this?
I learned about accessibility standards and how to apply them to a webpage. I also learned how to condense CSS elements for easier reading, and how to add comments so other web developers can see what's going on.
